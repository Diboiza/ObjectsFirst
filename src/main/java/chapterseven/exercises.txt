7.9 lookup the keyset method of in the documentation of the HashMap.
Answer: the keyset method returns a set of keys in the hashMap, remember a set stores only one item and no duplicates of that item.

7.10 Explain in detail and writing how the below unit of code works:
public String getExitString(){
        String returnString = "Exits:";
        Set<String> keys = exits.keySet();
        for (String key: keys) {
            returnString += " " + key;
        }
        return returnString;
    }
Answer: The methods first declares a String, then it declares a Set of Strings from the keyset of our hashmap.
It then iterates over the whole set and concatenates each to the declared String, once done it returns the string.
